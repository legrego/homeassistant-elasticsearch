## Getting Started

The Elasticsearch component requires, well, [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)!
This component will not host or configure Elasticsearch for you, but there are many ways to run your own cluster.
Elasticsearch is open source and free to use: just bring your own hardware!
Elastic has a [great setup guide](https://www.elastic.co/start) if you need help getting your first cluster up and running.

If you don't want to maintain your own cluster, then give the [Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud) a try! There is a free trial available to get you started.

## Setup (preferred method)

This component supports interactive configuration via Home Assistant's integration configuration page.
This will be the only supported configuration method in the future.

1. Restart Home-assistant once you've completed the installation instrictions above.
2. From the `Integrations` configuration menu, add a new `Elasticsearch` integration. ![img](assets/add-integration.png)
3. Provide connection information and optionally credentials to begin setup. ![img](assets/configure-integration.png)
4. Once the integration is setup, you may tweak all settings via the "Options" button on the integrations page.

## Setup (deprecated method)

This component supports yaml-based configuration, but this is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate to the UI-based approach outlined above. Please file an issue if you have any trouble migrating to the new setup process.

1. Copy the contents of `custom_components` to your `$HASS_CONFIG/custom_components` directory, where `$HASS_CONFIG` is the location on your machine where Home-Assistant lives.
   Example: `/home/pi/.homeassistant` and `/home/pi/.homeassistant/custom_components`. You may have to create the `custom_components` directory yourself.
2. Configure the component in `$HASS_CONFIG/configuration.yaml` (see Configuration section below)
3. Restart Home-Assistant
