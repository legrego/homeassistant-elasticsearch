The following table covers the Elasticsearch functionality used by the integration when configured against various versions of Elasticsearch:

| Elasticsearch Version | Time Series Datastreams | Datastreams       | Datastream Lifecycle Management | Index Lifecycle Management |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `8.11.0`+             | ✅&nbsp;Supported       |                   | ✅&nbsp;Supported               |                            |

!!! note
    Index Lifecycle Management is partially supported in versions `7.11.0` - `7.12.0`. The integration will create an ILM policy that performs time-based rollover but does not support shard-size-based rollover.

## Older versions

[Version `0.4.0`](https://github.com/legrego/homeassistant-elasticsearch/releases/tag/v0.4.0) includes support for older versions of Elasticsearch. No features or bugfixes will be backported to this version.
